For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

You can use the full build supplied by\n * Proj4js, or create a custom build to support those projections you need; see\n * the Proj4js website for how to do this. You also need the Proj4js definitions\n * for the required projections. These definitions can be obtained from\n * https://epsg.io/, and are a JS function, so can be loaded in a script\n * tag (as in the examples) or pasted into your application.\n *\n * After all required projection definitions are added to proj4's registry (by\n * using `proj4.defs()`), simply call `register(proj4)` from the `ol/proj/proj4`\n * package. Existing transforms are not changed by this function. See\n * examples/wms-image-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Additional projection definitions can be registered with `proj4.defs()` any\n * time. Just make sure to call `register(proj4)` again; for example, with user-supplied data where you don't\n * know in advance what projections are needed, you can initially load minimal\n * support and then load whichever are requested.\n *\n * Note that Proj4js does not support projection extents. If you want to add\n * one for creating default tile grids, you can add it after the Projection\n * object has been created with `setExtent`, for example,\n * `get('EPSG:1234').setExtent(extent)`.\n *\n * In addition to Proj4js support, any transform functions can be added with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. To use this, you must first create\n * a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} object for the new projection and add it with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}. You can then add the forward and inverse\n * functions with {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. See\n * examples/wms-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Note that if no transforms are needed and you only need to define the\n * projection, just add a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}.

Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An View has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But a View object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option.
